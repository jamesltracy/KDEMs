# KDEMs
This site provides a vignette for generating and analyzing a training set ensemble (TSE) of three kernel density estimation models (KDEMs) for spatial interpolation of species occurrence data, such as in the delineation of migration pathways. The R script and Arc python script, along with example data, are provided along with instructions in the Word Document KDEMVignetteInstructions.docx.
