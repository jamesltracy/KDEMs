# KDEMs: Kernel Density Estimation Models for Interpolative Species Distribution or Migration Models from Tracy et al. (submitted 2018)
This repository provides a vignette for generating and analyzing a training set ensemble (TSE) of three kernel density estimation models (KDEMs) for spatial interpolation of species occurrence data, such as in the delineation of migration pathways. The R script and Arc python script (for use in ArcGIS), along with example data, are provided, along with instructions in the Word document KDEMVignetteInstructions.docx.
